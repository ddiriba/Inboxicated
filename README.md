Inboxicated

https://inboxicated.wordpress.com/

Inboxicated is a device aimed at reducing the number of drivers operating motorvehicles under the influence of alcohol. It combines the power of machine learning, facial recognition, a FLIR camera, and motorized components to physically prevent someone from accessing their car keys when they are intoxicated.
